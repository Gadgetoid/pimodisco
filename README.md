# Pimoroni-Discord-Bot
This is the officially unofficial Pimoroni Discord bot!

Feel free to mess around with the code and make improvements where you can!

# Requirements:
* Python 3.5.x or later
* discord.py

You can install discord.py simply by using `sudo pip3 install discord` thanks to the amazing Gadgetoid.


# Running
In order to run this bot for yourself, you need:
- A Discord server within which you have permission to add a bot,
- An bot application, which can be created here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
- A bot token, which can replace "token" in the code,
- A bot client ID.

In order to add the bot to a server, simply navigate to https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT ID]&scope=bot&permissions=0, replacing [CLIENT ID] with your bot's client ID.
